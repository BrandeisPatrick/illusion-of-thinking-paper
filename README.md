# The Illusion of Thinking

An interactive demo exploring how AI reasoning models fail at the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. Based on Apple's research paper on the limitations of extended thinking in large language models.

**[Live Demo](https://brandeispatrick.github.io/illusion-of-thinking-paper/)**

## What This Demonstrates

The Tower of Hanoi puzzle requires tracking disk positions across many moves. As complexity increases:

| Difficulty | Disks | Optimal Moves | AI Performance |
|------------|-------|---------------|----------------|
| Easy | 4 | 15 | Most models succeed |
| Medium | 7 | 127 | Only GPT-5.1 with thinking succeeds |
| Hard | 10 | 1023 | **All models fail** |

This demonstrates that "thinking" tokens don't help with tasks requiring precise state tracking - the AI cannot maintain accurate mental state across hundreds of moves.

## Features

- Interactive Tower of Hanoi game
- Pre-cached responses from GPT-5 Nano, Mini, and 5.1
- Toggle reasoning ON/OFF to compare performance
- See token usage, reasoning tokens, and time taken
- Adjustable playback speed (1x, 5x, 10x, 20x)

## Run Locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000

## How It Works

This demo uses **pre-cached responses** from OpenAI's GPT-5 models. No API key is needed - all 18 model/difficulty/thinking combinations have been pre-generated and stored locally.

The cached responses include:
- The actual moves generated by each model
- Token usage (input, output, reasoning)
- Time taken to generate the response
- Whether the solution was correct
